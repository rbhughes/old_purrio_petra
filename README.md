[Petra](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ci/products/petra-geological-analysis.html) worker for [purr.io](https://github.com/rbhughes/purrio)

This is basically a web-sockets (via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) RealTime) client that collected geoscience data from (potentially) scattered databases on a LAN and populated a local PostgreSQL database (i.e. not Supabase) with FTS indexing.

Data lives on your local network; the hoste purr.io app is hosted on Vercel. So it's a hybrid-cloud search engine of sorts.
